Most of them are.\",\n    \"5-15s\": \"Your most personal health information is being packaged and sold to the highest bidder. It's invasive, insecure, and frankly, it's lazy tech.\",\n    \"15-45s\": \"So today, I started building a privacy-first alternative for WomenAI. All data lives and is processed on your device. Zero cloud. Zero tracking. I mapped out the core data models for cycles and symptoms. Then, I built a simple, local predictive model using a time-series analysis to forecast future cycles. No network requests with your personal data, ever. The entire logic is self-contained.\",\n    \"45-55s\": \"This shouldn't be revolutionary, it should be the standard. We're building WomenAI in the open. Join the build. The repo is in the bio.\"\n  },\n  \"visual_cues\": {\n    \"0-5s\": \"Fast-paced, text-on-screen hook. Glitchy, corrupted UI of a generic-looking period tracker app.\",\n    \"5-15s\": \"Quick cuts of stock footage representing data servers, charts, and money exchanging hands, overlaid with text like 'SOLD' and 'AD-TARGETING'.\",\n    \"15-45s\": \"High-speed screen recording of code being written. Focus on Python data classes (Cycle, Symptom, Event). Show a flash of a pandas DataFrame or a simple statistical model function. Use a dark terminal aesthetic. Overlay text like 'ON-DEVICE PROCESSING' and 'NO DATA LEAKS'. The visuals should look complex and fast, like a 'hacker' scene.\",\n    \"45-55s\": \"End on a clean, minimalist shot of the WomenAI GitHub repository page on a laptop. The project name is clearly visible. A final text overlay: 'WomenAI: Link in Bio'.\"\n  }\n}\n```",
