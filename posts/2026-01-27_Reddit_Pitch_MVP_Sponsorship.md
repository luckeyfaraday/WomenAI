**Name:** Carlo

**Country:** France

**Product:** ClaraAI — an AI health assistant designed specifically for women.

**MVP Link:** https://womenai.vercel.app

**The Problem:**

General-purpose AI assistants aren't built with women's health in mind. When a woman asks ChatGPT about her cycle, mood changes, or symptoms, she gets generic responses that lack context and emotional intelligence.

Women's health is deeply personal, often stigmatized, and chronically under-researched. Many women feel uncomfortable discussing these topics with doctors, let alone AI that treats them like edge cases.

ClaraAI is built from the ground up to understand:
- Menstrual cycle tracking and predictions
- Mental wellness support (mood tracking, guided support)
- Safety resources and crisis information

It's not just an AI that *can* talk about women's health. It's one that's *optimized* for it—with empathy, context, and zero judgment.

**Current State:**

MVP is live. Core features working:
- AI chat with women's health focus
- Cycle tracking
- Mood logging
- Google OAuth authentication
- Mobile app (Android APK via Capacitor)

Free tier with usage limits. Stripe integration ready for premium subscriptions.

**What I'd use the $3,000 for:**

1. **Marketing push** (~$1,500) — Targeted ads to validate demand and acquire first 500 users
2. **Infrastructure** (~$800) — Move from free tier hosting to production-grade (reduces latency, improves reliability)
3. **iOS deployment** (~$700) — Apple Developer account + MacOS build environment for App Store submission

This isn't about survival. It's about acceleration. The product works. I need to get it in front of the people it's built for.

## Strategy Notes

**Tone:** Direct, founder-to-founder, no fluff
**Goal:** Secure sponsorship/investment for ClaraAI
**Subreddit:** r/startups or similar

**Key differentiator:** MVP is already live and functional — not vaporware
