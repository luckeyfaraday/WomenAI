Hi, I'm building **WomenAI**.

**The Thesis:** General purpose LLMs are broad but shallow. The next big opportunity is **Vertical AI** that owns the context. WomenAI is a specialized companion that integrates hard utility (health data) with empathetic intelligence.

**The Product:**
*   **Integrated Health:** Native menstrual cycle & symptom tracking. The AI understands where you are in your cycle and adjusts advice/support accordingly.
*   **Safety & Wellness:** Built-in mood logging and curated safety resource database.
*   **Privacy First:** Secure architecture for sensitive health data.

**Current Status:**
*   **Live MVP:** Fully functional web application (React/Node/Postgres).
*   **Monetization:** Freemium model live via Stripe (Free/Premium tiers).
*   **Tech:** Leveraging Groq/Llama 3 for near-instant, natural conversation.

I'm a solo technical founder. The product is shipped and ready for users. Happy to go deeper.
