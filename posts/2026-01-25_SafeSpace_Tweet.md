## Alternative Options

### Option B (Focus on Privacy/Guest Mode)
```
Your health data is yours. Period.

That's why we just added a "Guest Mode" to ClaraAI.

Get the support and answers you need without creating an account or leaving a trace.

Privacy isn't a feature. It's a right. 🛡️

Your cycle is more than just a calendar date. It affects your mood, energy, and mind.

ClaraAI doesn't just track your period—it understands the context around it.
