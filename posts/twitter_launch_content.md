## Initial Tweet Thread (Launch Announcement)

### Tweet 1 (Main Announcement)
🌸 Introducing WomenAI – your personal AI health companion designed by women, for women.

We're building something different: an AI that actually understands women's health, respects your privacy, and puts YOU first.

Thread 🧵👇

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)
Let's be real: most health apps either:
❌ Treat you like a data point
❌ Ignore mental health completely  
❌ Sell your intimate data
❌ Give generic advice that doesn't fit YOUR body

We're changing that.

### Tweet 3 (What WomenAI Does)
WomenAI brings together:

🩸 Smart period tracking with actual insights
💭 Mental wellness support that gets it
🛡️ Safety resources when you need them
🤖 AI chat that feels like talking to a friend who cares

All private. All yours.

### Tweet 4 (Privacy-First)
Your health data is YOURS.

✅ End-to-end privacy
✅ No selling your data
✅ No judgment, ever
✅ Built on trust, not ads

We believe women deserve health tech they can actually trust.

### Tweet 5 (Join Beta / CTA)
We're launching beta soon and looking for women who want to be part of building this.

Interested? Drop a 💜 below or DM us.

Let's build women's health tech that actually works for us.

## Follow-up Tweets (Post-Launch)

### Educational Thread: Period Tracking
Did you know your cycle affects more than just your period? 🧵

WomenAI tracks patterns you didn't even know existed:
• Energy levels throughout your cycle
• Mood changes and what drives them  
• Best times for tough conversations
• When to schedule that big presentation

Your body has a rhythm. Let's work WITH it, not against it.

### Community Engagement Tweet
What's the ONE thing you wish health apps actually understood about women's health?

We're listening. 👂💜

(And yes, we're building it into WomenAI)

### Mental Wellness Tweet
Bad mental health day? WomenAI gets it.

No toxic positivity. No "just meditate."

Real support:
✨ Grounding exercises that work
✨ Talk it out with AI who listens
✨ Resources when you need more
✨ Reminders that you're not alone

You deserve better than "self-care Sunday" content.

### Safety Resources Tweet
WomenAI includes instant access to:

🆘 Emergency contacts
📍 Safe location sharing
⚖️ Legal resources
🏥 Health providers
💬 Crisis support

Because safety isn't optional. 

Your well-being matters, and we've got your back.

### Feature Highlight Tweet
"Wait, the AI actually understands PMS isn't just being moody?"

Yes. 😌

WomenAI is trained on women's health research, not bro-science.

It knows:
• Hormones affect EVERYTHING  
• Period pain is real
• Mental health isn't "drama"
• Every body is different

Finally.

### Behind-the-Scenes Tweet  
Building WomenAI feels different.

Every feature we ship, we ask: "Would this actually help my sister? My best friend? Me?"

If the answer isn't HELL YES, we rebuild it.

Women's health deserves that standard.
