# X (Twitter) Repurposing: The WomenAI Overhaul Thread

**Tone:** Technical, Focused, Empathetic.

---

**Tweet 1 (The Hook)**
Most AI wrappers are trapped in a browser tab.

But for a health companion, mobile accessibility is mandatory.

We just finished a massive technical overhaul of WomenAI to solve the web-to-mobile "Authentication Gap".

Here is how we built a unified local brain for health: 🧵

**Tweet 2 (The Cookie Problem)**
The biggest hurdle? Standard session cookies fail in an Android APK environment.

If you want a seamless transition from web to mobile, you need a hybrid model.

We moved to **Hybrid Token/Cookie Auth**.

**Tweet 3 (The Solution)**
How it works:
• Web users: Secure, HttpOnly cookies.
• Mobile (APK) users: Token Exchange via Deep Linking.

When you log in on mobile, the backend hands off a JWT that the app captures and stores securely. 

Unified context. Zero friction. ⚡

**Tweet 4 (Mobile-First UX)**
Desktop sidebars are for mice. Mobile apps are for thumbs.

We refactored the entire frontend to a **Strict Bottom-Tab Navigation**.

It’s about more than just "responsiveness". It’s about ergonomics and reducing cognitive load.

**Tweet 5 (Merging Context)**
We merged the "History" and "Tracking" tabs into a single view.

Now, users can see their AI health insights alongside their cycle data without jumping between pages.

Simplicity = Retention.

**Tweet 6 (The Stack)**
The WomenAI Infrastructure:
• Vite / React (Frontend)
• Node / Express (Backend)
• Neon DB (PostgreSQL)
• Groq SDK (Low-latency AI)

Fast. Secure. Local-first.

**Tweet 7 (Closing)**
We aren't just building a chatbot. We are building a safe, agentic infrastructure for women's health.

The v1.1 update is live.
